We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."

    "I would create a dataframe that collected the times that the customers would repay the bills for the main categories. The time it takes to pay back the bills will be a separate column in the dataframe. Next, I would create a scatterplot to see the correlation between how long it took for each category to be paid back. The time could be the x-axis, and the various categories could be the y-axis. Then, if I were to choose a random point on the scatterplot, I could see the KNN of the plot to find what is the most likely time the bill would be paid."
